        <h1>Nissan 300zx Information</h1>

        <p>
            The Nissan 300ZX is a sports car in the Nissan Z-car family that was produced across two similar but unique
            generations. As with all other versions of the Z, the 300ZX was sold within the Japanese domestic market
            under the name <strong>Fairlady Z</strong>.<br><br>

            Sold in Japan from 1983 to 2001 and in the United States from 1984 through 1996, the 300ZX name followed
            the numerical convention initiated with the original Z car, the Nissan S30, which was marketed in the U.S.
            as the 240Z. The addition of the "X" to the car's name was a carryover from its predecessor, the 280ZX, and
            signified the presence, either standard or optional, of rear seats.<br><br>

            Despite the presence of that additional equipment, the <strong>first generation "Z31"</strong> variant of
            the 300ZX
            (1983-1989) continued in the tradition of the original S30 as a mid-priced model. The <strong>
                second generation
                "Z32"
            </strong> was driven up-market, being faster, more capable, more advanced, and much higher priced than its
            predecessor, with consecutive price increases each model year of availability. As such, the Z31 was the
            more accessible, and ultimately the more popular model, selling over 100,000 more units in total than the
            Z32. In 1983-1984 the Nissan 300ZX Turbo brand new priced around $12,000-$18,000<br><br>

            <aside>The 300zx is now a very rare car to spot to this day</aside>
            Car and Driver placed the Z32 on its Ten Best list for 7 consecutive years, each model year of its
            availability in the United States. Motor Trend awarded it as the 1990 Import Car of the Year. The Nissan
            350Z, officially the Z33 generation Z-Car, succeeded the 300ZX in 2003.<br>
