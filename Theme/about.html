        <h1> Nissan Z</h1>

        <p>
            The <strong>Nissan Z</strong> is a sports car that is manufactured by
            Nissan Moters Ltd. This specific model has been in production since
            1969 and has gone through six generations.
            <br><br>
            This Website is more educational purposes only. I describe the evolution in car generations that
            the nissan model "z" goes throught the year.

        <h1>My Interest on the Topic</h1>

        <p>I started growing an interest in cars when i saw my first <strong>Nissan GTR</strong>. The first thing that
            came to my mind
            is that it was such a cool looking car so I did my research. Finding out that the car cost $60,000 and more
            I went to look
            and see if Nissan had any more models of sport cars. Soon enough I ran into the 350Z, one that I can
            actually afford.<br> I started to to research
            in finding the strength and weaknesses of the car, and to my surprise many people say the quickness and the
            engineering of the car make it a good
            bang for your buck. It was 3 years later from the time i started doing research is when i bought my first
            Nissan 350Z
            I fell in love, knowing that there was a later model (the 370z) i still preffered the look of the
            predeccesor. Sadly the dream fell quick
            and a close friend totaled the car. I do plan on getting another one but later in the future. For now i
            still do research learning more and more
            about my favorite car.</p>
