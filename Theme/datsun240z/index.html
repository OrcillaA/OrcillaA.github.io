        <h1>Datsun 240z Information</h1>

        <p>The 1970 240Z was introduced to the American market by <strong>Yutaka Katayama</strong>, president of Nissan
            Motors USA
            operations, widely known as "Mister K". The 1970 through the mid-1971 model year 240Z was referred to as
            the Series I.
            These early cars had many subtle but notable features differing from later cars. The most easily visible
            difference is that these early cars had a chrome 240Z badge on the sail pillar,
            and two horizontal vents in the rear hatch below the glass molding providing flow through ventilation. In
            mid-1971, for the Series II 240Z-cars, the sail pillar emblems were restyled with just the letter Z placed
            in a circular
            vented emblem, and the vents were eliminated from the hatch panel of the car. Design changes for the US
            model 240Z occurred throughout production, including interior modifications for
            the 1972 model year, and a change in the location of the bumper over-riders, as well as the addition of
            some emission control devices and the adoption of a new style of emissions reducing carburetors for the
            1973 model year.</p>

        <h1>Motor Information</h1>

        <p>The Datsun 240z's engine was called the "L24", which was a in-line six cylinder signle overhead camshaft.
            this gave it a maximum hoursepower of 151 @ 5600rpm</p>
