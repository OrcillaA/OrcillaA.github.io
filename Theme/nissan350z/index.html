        <h1>Nissan 350z information</h1>

        <p>
            The <strong>Nissan 350Z</strong> (known as <strong>Nissan Fairlady Z</strong> in Japan) is a two-door,
            two-seater sports car that was
            manufactured by Nissan Motors from 2002 to 2009 and marks the fifth generation of Nissan's Z-car line. The
            350Z entered production in late 2002 and was sold and marketed as a 2003 model. The first year there was
            only a coupe, as the roadster did not debut until the following year.<br><br>
            Initially, the coupe came in Base,
            Enthusiast, Performance, Touring and Track versions, while the Roadster was limited to Enthusiast and
            Touring trim levels. The Track trim came with lightweight wheels and Brembo brakes, but its suspension
            tuning was the same as all other coupes. The Nissan 350Z has been succeeded by the 370Z since the 2009
            model year.

        <h1>Motor Information</h1>

        <p>
            The Nissan 350z had three types of engines throught the years of release.

            <ul>
                <li>2003-2005: VQ35DE 3.5 L (210 cu in) V6
                    276 hp (206 kW; 280 PS) at 6,200 rpm
                    274 lb⋅ft (371 N⋅m) at 4,800 rpm</li>
                <li>2006: VQ35DE 3.5 L (210 cu in) V6
                    300 hp (224 kW; 304 PS) at 6,400 rpm
                    260 lb⋅ft (353 N⋅m) at 4,800 rpm</li>
                <li>2007-2008: VQ35HR 3.5 L (210 cu in) V6
                    306 hp (228 kW; 310 PS) at 6,800 rpm
                    268 lb⋅ft (363 N⋅m) at 4,800 rpm</li>
            </ul>

            The difference between the 03-05 and the 06 VQ35DE is that the 06 is producing
            more horsepower and torque at a higher rpm, 300hp at 6,400rpm vs 276hp at 6,200rpm.
            The VQ35HR is the majoir difference in engine changes, adding one more intake and increasing the rpm limit.
            This resulted in the VQ35HR producing an increase in horsepower at 306hp at 6,800rpm. The "hr" motor also
            fixed
            ongoing problems the previous years had such as, oil consumption problems.
