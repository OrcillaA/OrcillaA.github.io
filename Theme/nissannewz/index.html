        <h1>Rumors and Concepts</h1>

        <p>At the beginning September 2018 rumors have been spreading that there will be a new Nissan Z in production.
            Many are predicting they will reveal the new generation at the Tokyo Motor Show which is scheduled to
            happen
            October 2019. Apperently the play is to team up with <strong>Mercedes</strong> and bring in a new concept
            to how
            the engine is built. It will replace the original 3.7 V6 with 4 cylinder engine that will possibly have two
            sets of
            turbos.

        <h1>Modifications and Custom work</h1>

        <p>
            Many individuals who own a Z often times modify their car. Whether it's for style or performance each one
            has
            a unique sense of taste towards the owner. I myself have owned a 2008 350z and I can say it was an
            experience to have.
            The interior feels like a rocketship with every display turned towards the driver geared to give that
            experience where
            you have a personal connection and control of the car.<br><br>
            Even though it sounds like a close to perfect car everything has its flaws. The Z's are know to have a lot
            of road noise when
            when taking it for a drive. Also the interior material is made out of a cheap plastic that scratches
            easily. Most Z's that you find
            "used" will most likely have interior mark ups.<br><br>
            Here is a photot of my Z before I had to sadly say goodbye to it.</p>
